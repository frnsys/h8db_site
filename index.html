        <div class="about">
            <p>h8base is an open source research and database project made by <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinesinders">Caroline Sinders</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frnsys">Francis Tseng</a> as a part of the Eyebeam + BuzzFeed Open Lab Residency. Caroline has spent the past year studying the alt-right as a part of her residency. Francis is a machine learning researcher who has studied online communities and the algorithmic tools they use.</p>
            <p>Often sentiment analysis and toxic language analysis models for natural language processing *can't* recognize racism, misogyny, and hate speech. h8base is a dictionary designed to help tag, define, and explain hate speech words that can fall through the cracks for language models.</p>
            <p>This is a project aims to aid in decoding and highlighting hate speech, alt-right websites, alt-right, white nationalist and neo-nazi figures, and specific kinds of coded hate speech that may seem innocuous.</p>
